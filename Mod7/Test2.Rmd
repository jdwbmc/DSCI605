```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

Set the working directory:

```{r directory, include=FALSE}
setwd("~/GitHub/DSCI605/Mod7")
library(tidyverse)
library(tinytex)
```

# 1. How to emebed image into R Markdnow

This is an example of embedding images in your local folder into R Markdown.
For example, I have a illustration graph of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra under the folder Mod7. 

![This is my own caption](Histogram_png.png)

This is another way to insert the image and set the position for the image.

```{r rein0, include = TRUE,fig.align = 'center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:rein0}Resized Schematic illustration of my own file."}

knitr::include_graphics("AI4.jpg")
```

# 2. Create a high quality figure in R Markdown

This is an example of plotting graphs by setting the plotting area and resolution.
For example, I create a histogram below and set the width, height and resolution in the Chunk options. You can also define the figure size in YAML header and/or define the figure size as global chunk option. This is my own text.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
    ```{r figs1, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.res=300, echo=FALSE,    fig.cap="\\label{fig:figs1}A basic histogram of the file incomes"}
        library(ggplot2)
        df <- read.csv("Income-by-states.csv")
        #plot the basic histogram
        ggplot(df, aes(x=income)) + 
          geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, color="black", fill="blue")

    ```
\end{minipage}%
  \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
    This text appears next to the image. Adjust the minipage widths as necessary.
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}


# 3. Refer to the figure by indexing the figure.

In Figure \ref{fig:figs1}, we see that the distribution of incomes is close to a normal distribution.
In Figure \ref{fig:rein0}, we see the illustration graph.

# 4. Create tables using the kable function from the knitr package.

kable takes a data.frame as input, and outputs the table into a markdown table, which will get rendered into the appropriate output format.

For example, let’s say we wanted to share the first 6 rows of our mtcars data.

This gives us the following output:
```{r tabl,include=TRUE}
top_mtcars <- head(mtcars)

knitr::kable(top_mtcars,caption= "A Knitr's kable to show the first six rows of 'mtcars'",digits=2)

```

# 5. Refer to the tables


For example, let’s say we wanted to share the first 10 rows of our mtcars data.

This gives us the following output:
```{r tabl1,include=TRUE}
top_mtcars <- head(mtcars,10)

knitr::kable(top_mtcars, caption= "A Knitr's kable to show the first ten rows of 'mtcars'", digits=2) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

```

In Table \ref{tab:tbl1}, we see the first **10** rows  of the dataset "mtcars".
