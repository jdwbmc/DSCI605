# 1. How to emebed image into R Markdnow

This is an example of embedding images in your local folder into R Markdown.
For example, I have a illustration graph of the links between packages ggplot2, gtable, grid, egg and gridExtra under the folder Mod7. This plot approach only works for HTML.  It does not work for a pdf or LaTex approach which uses LaTex for for figure referencing.

![This is my own caption](Histogram_png.png)

This is another way to insert the image and set the position for the image.  However, in this approach there is no way to keep the figure with the text.

```{r rein0, include = TRUE,fig.align = 'center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:rein0}Resized Schematic illustration of my own file."}

knitr::include_graphics("AI4.jpg")
```

This is still another way to insert the image and set the position for the image.  Using LaTex, it keeps the figure with the text.

\begin{figure}[H]  % Forcing the image to be placed right here
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{AI4.jpg}
  \caption{Another Schematic of my own AI file.}
  \label{fig:rein1}
\end{figure}



# 2. Create a high quality figure in R Markdown

This is an example of plotting graphs by setting the plotting area and resolution.
For example, I create a histogram below and set the width, height and resolution in the Chunk options. You can also define the figure size in YAML header and/or define the figure size as global chunk option. This is my own text.

```{r save_plot, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv("Income-by-states.csv")
ggsave("histogram3_plot.png", ggplot(df, aes(x=income)) + 
      geom_histogram(binwidth=10000, color="black", fill="green"), width = 7, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{histogram3_plot.png}
  \end{minipage}%
  \begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
    \centering
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{A histogram of incomes by state}
  \label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

# 3. Refer to the figure by indexing the figure.

In Figure \ref{fig:figs1}, we see that the distribution of incomes is close to a normal distribution.
In Figure \ref{fig:rein0}, we see the illustration graph.  There is no correct labeling of Figure 1, so it cannot be found.

# 4. Create tables using the kable function from the knitr package.

kable takes a data.frame as input, and outputs the table into a markdown table, which will get rendered into the appropriate output format.

For example, let’s say we wanted to share the first 6 rows of our mtcars data.

This gives us the following output:
```{r tabl,include=TRUE}
top_mtcars <- head(mtcars)

knitr::kable(top_mtcars,caption= "A Knitr's kable to show the first six rows of 'mtcars'",digits=2)

```

# 5. Refer to the tables


For example, let’s say we wanted to share the first 10 rows of our mtcars data.

This gives us the following output:
```{r tabl1,include=TRUE}
top_mtcars <- head(mtcars,10)

knitr::kable(top_mtcars,caption= "A Knitr's kable to show the first ten rows of 'mtcars'",digits=2)

```

In Table \ref{tab:tbl1}, we see the first **10** rows  of the dataset "mtcars".

Let's try this again:

```{r tabl3,include=TRUE}
mytop_mtcars <- head(mtcars,10)
    
knitr::kable(mytop_mtcars, digits=2, caption = "A Knitr's kable to show the first ten rows of 'mtcars' \\label{tab:tabl3}") 
```

Once again in Table \ref{tab:tabl3}, we see the first **10** rows  of the dataset "mtcars".
